    <string name="about_reps">
        Reps is a fitness app equipped with a diverse array of integrated features including body composition tracking,
        a calendar &amp; journal, nutrition &amp; recipes, workouts &amp; exercises, goal tracking &amp; checklists, exploration of nearby
        gyms and cafes. Reps merges and consolidates the scattered functionality of most current fitness apps on the market
        and eliminates the need for users to navigate multiple applications for distinct elements of fitness, as everything
        is integrated into a singular app.
        \n\n
        Currently, the fitness apps on the market are designed to fulfil a singular requirement. Many fitness enthusiasts are
        constrained to use multiple fitness apps for their individual and isolated features, such as goal tracking, exercise
        and workout program regimes, nutrition logging and journaling. There is a gap in the market for
        an app which fulfils all of these requirements, until now. Reps aims to combine all of elements of fitness into a
        singular app, rendering the user a much more connected and convenient fitness experience as Reps negates the necessity
        to use a multitude of divided apps.
